## Introduction
This repository contains code and required to build your own Mini Video Player.  Information found in this repository accompanies the "Open Source Mini Video Player" build video on the Super Make Something YouTube page, which can be found here: LINK COMING SOON!

Please watch the accompanying project video and read through this README file before beginning assembly of your PCB. For the 'Over 9000' configuration, the potentiometer of the battery charger and boost module must be adjusted so that it has a 5V output voltage in order to not damage the ESP32.

## Installation instructions and required libraries
The `Code` folder contains all of the files needed to compile the project.  The folder `miniVideoVideoPlayer` contains the miniVideoPlayer.ino file, which should be opened in the Arduino IDE.  Folders in the `libraries` directory should be copied to the location of where your other Arduino libraries are installed.  For Windows users, this is typically under `Documents\Arduino\libraries`.
